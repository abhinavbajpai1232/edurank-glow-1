Place the imported game repositories here. Example structure:

- games/epic-era-battles/*   -> full game repo files (index.html, assets...)
- games/rushlane-x/*         -> full game repo files

To make the games playable inside BrainBuddy during development, copy each game's built `index.html` and assets into `public/games/<game-id>/`.
